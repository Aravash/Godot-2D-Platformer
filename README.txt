This is a small vertical slice of some characters whose sprites I personally ripped from Black Belt Challenge, a little known Game Boy game that I loved playing when I was younger! There is class and inheritence structure for entities and further for enemies, a small custom shader which lets you change sprite colours of the enemies(too lazy to rip more sprites! :D) and some varied attacks that change depending on if you are crouching or not.

Movement and Jumping: Arrow keys

Z - punch
X - kick
C - special

doing the above with DOWN pressed does a heavier attack
